Introduction
In this lab we have learned how to make our own libraries and write unit tests for them. We made two classes. One for stack and one for factorial. For factorial, we called the function recursively and displayed the result. For stack, we built the functions with isEmpty, Isfull, push and pop properties.
Approach
We used the unit test approach in this lab. We created two classes. One for stack and one for factorial and then applied unit tests on both the projects. For stack, we built the functions with isEmpty, Isfull, push and pop properties. . For factorial, we called the function recursively and displayed the result.

How to Run
•	Create a console application 
•	A .cpp file is created
•	Create a header file
•	Write separate code for the header file and the source file
•	Create unit test for the project
 

 

Analysis
Unit testing is really important as it helps us in realizing our mistakes in the program. Unit testing is done in such a way that the main project is divided into small parts and then tested separately.
